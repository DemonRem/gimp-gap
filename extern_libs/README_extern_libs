The GIMP-GAP distribution contains some libraries
as sourcecode for convenient static linking.

CURRENT FFMPEG version is:

- ffmpeg 0.6.1

CURRENT LIBMPEG3 version is:
       
- libmpeg3-1.8

The gimp-gap project does NOT maintain the sourcecode for those libs !
Bugs related to those libraries are never fixed here.
Future releases of gimp-gap may include newer versions
of those libs.



---------------
ffmpeg
--------------

GIMP-GAP uses the libraries 
   libavformat, libavcodec, libavutil, libavdevice and libswscale
   (libavcore -- new lib in latest snaphots of ffmpeg, not yet required)
that are part of ffmpeg. 
Those libs build up the basic videofile support for 
many MPEG based fileformats, both for read and write access 
(frame and audio extraction, and for the powerful video encoder plug-in
 "FFMPEG" in the Master Videoencoder dialog).
		    
You can get ffmpeg at:
    http://www.ffmpeg.org/
    or http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/download.html
    (old http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net)

   
It is highly recommanded to use the ffmpeg tarball that is included in
this GIMP-GAP distribution. 

  The ongoing ffmpeg development sometimes introduces incompatible changes
  that would require changes and extension in the GIMP-GAP 
  modules to enable compile together with GIMP-GAP.
  A succsessful build is no guarantee that GIMP-GAP
  will work with a new ffmpeg version.
  Typically it requires much testing and some knowledge
  of both GIMP-GAP and ffmpeg internals to get new ffmpeg versions
  working. 
  
  GIMP-GAP currently supports 
  o) ffmpeg-0.6.1 tests repeated, same results as ffmpeg-0.6
  o) ffmpeg-0.6 basically works, tests done 
     incopatibility detected at frame exact positioning compared against ffmpeg-0.5 
     on dvd mpeg2 encoded videos that do not start with a keyframe.
     (No idea how to fix, there are no plans to investigate more effort on this...)

  o) ffmpeg-0.5 successfully tested with many videoformats
     but does no longer work with recent version of libx264 (X264_BUILD 93)
     (use gimp-gap configure option --disable-ff-libx264
     when compiling/linking with ffmpeg-0.5)
     


  newer ffmpeg GIT (or SVN) snapshots
  may or may not compile, link and run with this GIMP-GAP release.
  (a compile/link test was done with ffmpeg-2010-09-14 snapshot
  that has no more support for libfaad --disable-ff-libfaad)


GIMP-GAP can be configured to be compiled without ffmpeg (in this case 
with reduced functionality at video encoding and decoding)

    --disable_gva_libavformat

If you want to try other versions you can download the ffmpeg tarball
and move the extracted sourcecode directory to

   <GIMP-GAP-sourcedir>/extern_libs/ffmpeg

NOTE: Older ffmpeg versions that once worked with older GIMP-GAP
  releases definitly will NOT compile / work with this GIMP-GAP release.

  GIMP-GAP has dropped support for the follwing old ffmpeg versions: 


   ffmpeg-export-snapshot.2009.01.31.tar.bz2
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2008.01.13.tar.bz2
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.12.20.tar.bz2
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.10.31.tar.bz2
  
       the option --enable-x264 was renamed to --enable-libx264

   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.05.15.tar.bz2
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.04.20.tar.bz2
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.04.04.tar.bz2 (Revision 8608)
   ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.03.06.tar.bz2

   ffmpeg-CVS-2005.04.08  (Support dropped)
   ffmpeg-CVS-2005.03.02  (Support dropped)
   ffmpeg-0.4.9pre1       (outdated official release is NOT SUPPORTED)
   ffmpeg 0.4.8           (outdated stable release is NOT SUPPORTED) 
   


---------------
libmpeg3
--------------

GIMP-GAP uses the library libmpeg3 for decoding MPEG videos.
(frame and audio extraction).
With libmpeg3 access to VCD and DVD is supported. 
This includes read access to .vob and .ifo files.

GIMP-GAP was tested with libmpeg3-1.8
The sourcecode of this libmpeg3 version is included in the GIMP-GAP
distribution as tarball.

You can get libmpeg3 at:
  http:/prdownloads.sourceforge.net/heroines/libmpeg3-1.8-src.tar.bz2
  old: http://www.heroinewarrior.com/download.php3


Notes:
- it is recommanded to use the libmpeg3 tarball that is included in
  this GIMP-GAP distribution.

- older GIMP-GAP versions had included libmpeg3-1.5.4,
  this version is no longer supported.
