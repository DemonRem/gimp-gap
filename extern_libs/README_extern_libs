The GIMP-GAP distribution contains some libraries
as sourcecode for convenient static linking.

CURRENT FFMPEG version is:

- ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.10.31.tar.bz2

   Note: liba52 is no longer included in recent SVN snapshots
   
       ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static --disable-mmx --enable-gpl --enable-liba52

       results in ERROR: liba52 not found
       (older releases had liba52 subdirectory in libavcodec)
       
       
       
- libmpeg3-1.5.4

The gimp-gap project does NOT maintain the sourcecode for those libs !
Bugs related to those libraries are never fixed here.
Future releases of gimp-gap may include newer versions
of those libs.



---------------
ffmpeg
--------------

GIMP-GAP uses the libraries libavformat and libavcodec
that are part of ffmpeg. 
libavformat and libavcodec build up the basic videofile support for 
many MPEG based fileformats, both for read and write access 
(frame and audio extraction, and for the powerful video encoder plug-in
 "FFMPEG" in the Master Videoencoder dialog).
		    
You can get ffmpeg at:
    http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net


GIMP-GAP was developed and tested with several ffmpeg versions.
The code still should compile and run with following versions:

   ==> BUG_001: read after seek fails on most MPEG1 videos
                (test with old gimp-gap and ffmpeg-CVS-2005.04.08
                shows the same problem !!)


 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2008.01.13.tar.bz2  NOT USABLE BREAKS video index compatibility
 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.12.20.tar.bz2  NOT USABLE BREAKS video index compatibility
 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.10.31.tar.bz2
  
       the option --enable-x264 was renamed to --enable-libx264

 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.05.15.tar.bz2
 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.04.20.tar.bz2                  BUG_001
 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.04.04.tar.bz2 (Revision 8608)  BUG_001
 - ffmpeg-export-snapshot-2007.03.06.tar.bz2                  BUG_001



   
It is recommanded to use the ffmpeg tarball that is included in
this GIMP-GAP distribution. 

  The ongoing ffmpeg development sometimes introduces incompatible changes
  that would require changes and extension in the GIMP-GAP 
  modules to enable compile together with GIMP-GAP and much testing
  to check if the new ffmpeg version will work. 
  
  Therefore i decided to include an ffmpeg  SVN snaphot
  that was tested with GIMP-GAP during April/May and November 2007

  new ffmpeg SVN snapshots
  may or may not compile, link and run with this GIMP-GAP release.


GIMP-GAP can be configured to be compiled without ffmpeg (in this case 
with reduced functionality at video encoding and decoding)

    --disable_gva_libavformat

If you want to try other versions you can download the ffmpeg tarball
and move the extracted sourcecode directory to

   <GIMP-GAP-sourcedir>/extern_libs/ffmpeg

NOTE: Older ffmpeg versions that once worked with older GIMP-GAP
releases definitly will NOT compile / work with this GIMP-GAP release.

   GIMP-GAP has dropped support for the follwing old ffmpeg versions: 
   ffmpeg-CVS-2005.04.08  (Support dropped)
   ffmpeg-CVS-2005.03.02  (Support dropped)
   ffmpeg-0.4.9pre1       (latest, but outdated official release is NOT SUPPORTED)
   ffmpeg 0.4.8           (outdated stable release is NOT SUPPORTED) 
   


---------------
libmpeg3
--------------

GIMP-GAP uses the library libmpeg3 for decoding MPEG videos.
(frame and audio extraction).
With libmpeg3 access to VCD and DVD is supported. 
This includes read access to .vob and .ifo files.

GIMP-GAP was developed and tested with libmpeg3-1.5.4
The sourcecode of this libmpeg3 version is included in the GIMP-GAP
distribution as tarball.

You can get libmpeg3 at:
  http://www.heroinewarrior.com/download.php3


Note: the original has no installation support,
it is recommanded to use the libmpeg3 tarball that is included in
this GIMP-GAP distribution.
