Here is a short overview whats new in GIMP-GAP-2.1:
(compared to gimp-gap release 2.0.2)

WARNING: *** 
please note that GIMP-GAP-2.1 is an UNSTABLE developers
version only. Some of the new features are just partly implemented
and may crash or deliver unexpected results. 


- support upto 8 framenumber digits for frame images (mplayer style)
  (older support was limited to 6 digits)

- Videoapi (GVA) for read access in videofiles (.mpg, .avi ....)
  (frames and audio)

- Videoextract Plug-In
   extract frames and/or audio samples
   from a videofile, based on the GAP Video API (GVA))

- Videoextract Plug-In based on external program MPlayer

- Storyboard dialog to create and edit
  Videocliplists (Storyboard text files)
  usable for Encoding Videofiles
  with the new Master Videoencoder plug-in.

- Player can run in as widget
  in the storyboard dialog and the videoextract plug-in.

- The Player can trace the displayed frames
  in a multilayer image.

- Storyboard and Player
  can optional use the GAP Video API (GVA)
  to access frames in videofiles (.mpg, .avi ....)

- Master Videoencoder plug-in
  This is a Common GUI to
  encode GAP framesequences or STORYBOARD files
  to one videofile, including audio.
  The user can select all registered
  Video Encoder plug-ins.
  
- Videoencoder Plug-ins
   AVI Encoder         (based on avilib, codecs: RAW, JPG, XVID)
   FFMPEG Encoder      (based on ffmpeg, handles many MPEG based
                        videoformats and codecs,
                        see ffmpeg docs for detailed information)
   SINGLEFRAME Encoder (generate GIMP-GAP typical frame sequences
                        as output. This may be useful
                        to convert STORYBAORD Files to frame sequences)

- Morph Plug-in
  generate tween layers with metamorphose transformations
  from source layer to destination layer
  The user can set controlpoints for the warp part of the
  transformation to track details.

- Extended Onionskin Configuration
  allows now bidirectional references.
  (refer to frames +n and -n in the same frame)

- Added new functions to modify frames plug-in
   "Copy layermask from layer above"
   "Copy layermask from layer below"

- Active layer tracking by name or stackposition.
   This feature tries to set the active layer at framechanges
   in the new loaded frame by matching layername (or stackposition)
   to the active layer of the previously displayed frame.

- Move-Path Plug-in:
  Additional methode for converting gimp-bezier paths to GIMP-GAP
  contolpoints in the MovePath tool.
  (SHIFT Grab Path allows smoother match to the bezier curve
   depending on the number of handled frames)
  
  Multiple functions of the "Reset All Points" button.
  SHIFT: copy settings of the 1.st controlpoint to all other controlpoints
  CTRL:  mix settings of 1.st and last controlpoint into the 
  other controlpoints inbetween.

old news

Here is a short overview whats new in GIMP-GAP-2.0.2:
(compared to the gap version that once was part of gimp-1.2.x release)

 - new bluebox plug-in makes selected color transparent.

 - new features for the "MovePath" plug-in
   - animated perspective transformations
   - optional respect selected areas of the moving source object
     (with animated adjustable feather_radius)
   - integrated bluebox filter can be applied to the moving source object
   - tracelayer creation
     collects all scenes from start to current frame in one tracelayer.
   - tween processing for fast moving objects.
     collects scenes between 2 frames in the tweenlayer.
   - grab controlpoints from current GIMP-path
   - dynamic resize of the preview to follow current windowsize.
   - optional instant apply for the preview

 - playback for video frames to give a motionpreview
   in thumbnail quality.
   On linux the playback has audiosupport to play a wavefile
   synchron with the videoframes

 - the onionskin plug-ins are now integrated to gimp-gap.
   onionskin layer(s) usually do show previous (or next) frame(s)
   of the video in the current frame.

 - new features in "frames to multilayer image" plug-in
   optional respect selection(s) in the sourceframes

 - new features in "frames modify" plug-in
   - new functions to
     set/delete/invert selection in all handled frames
 
 - renumber plug-in for renaming frames (on disk) 
   you can set a new starting number for the first frame
   and define how much digits (leading zeroes)
   to use for the framenumber part.
 
 - change framedensity
   useful for changing the framerate without changing the
   playback speed. duplicates frames to get higher density
   or deletes frames to reduce density.
 
 - render filename (or just the number part) to layer

 - support of the open thumbnail standard
   (thumbnailfiles in png fileformat in $HOME/.thumbnails
    that allows better quality than the old .xvpics thumbnail standard)
 
 - filtermacro scriptfiles
   assemble filtermacro scriptfiles by picking filtercalls from the
   current session and execute them later all together at one drawable.
 
 - gimp-gap now uses the preferences value save always/only on changes
   (gimprc keyword "trust-dirty-flag")
   for unconditional/conditional implicite save operations
   when stepping from frame to frame.

 - vcr-navigator internal changes
   (now handles unlimited number of frames)

 - some minor layout changes.

 - internal reorganisations/cleanup of the sourcecode
   including porting to new GIMP-2.0 and GTK+2.2 api.
