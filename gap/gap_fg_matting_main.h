 *    foreground extraction based on alpha matting algorithm.
 *    Render transparancy for a layer based on a tri-map drawable (provided by the user).
 *    The tri-map defines what pixels are FOREGROUND (white) BACKGROUND (black) or UNDEFINED (gray).
 *    foreground extraction affects the UNDEFINED pixels and calculates transparency for those pixels.
 *
 *    This module provides main data structures of the plug-in
