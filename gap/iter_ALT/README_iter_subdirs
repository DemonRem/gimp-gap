Subdirectorys for Iterator_ALT Procedure include files.

 gen ... Contains the unchanged Generated Code
          some of the generated iterators (that did not work)
          were moved to  Subdirectory gen_deleted
          (gen_deleted is not part of the gap release tar-file)
 
 mod ... Contains the Hand-Modified Code
         for those Plugins where the generated iter_ALT
         Code did not work.
         (their Last-Value Buffer structure did not
          math the PDB-Paraeter description) 

 old ... Contains Hand-Modified (or generated) old
         Iterators.
         (For Plugins that are not part of gimp 1.1.3
          but once were part of gimp 1.0 or prior releases)
          

2003.09.21: hof: this concept is no longer supported
            (it would move files from one dir to another
	     on changes. 
	     but i think for the CVS archive history it would
	     be better, when the sourcecode stays in the same dir.)
	     
	     All new iterators go into the mod directory now.
