/* gap_frame_fetcher.h
 *
 *
 *  The FrameFetcher provides access to frames both from imagefiles and videofiles.
 *  
 *  It holds a global image cache of temporary gimp images intended for
 *  read only access in various gimp-gap render processings.
 *  
 *  There are methods to get the temporary image 
 *  or to get a duplicate that has only one layer at imagesize.
 *  (merged or picked via desired stackposition)
 *
 *  For videofiles it holds a cache of open videofile handles.
 *  (note that caching of videoframes is already available in the videohandle)
 *
