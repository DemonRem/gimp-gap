Here is a result List of the "Animated Filtercall" Tests.
  I tested all the listed PDB-Procedures
  that can be selected via the GAP's DB-Browser
  and the corresponding _iter_ALT Procedures
  on a 4-Layer Testimage with Menu.

   TODO: check for new plug ins that were added to gimp-2.6
   (and that are not yet in this List)

   Test with PDB-Procedures (Plugins) that came with
   gimp release 2.6.4 
   Test also includes PDB-Procedures provided by GIMP-GAP itself


State: (Column1 test 2007.12.01, Column2 older testresult with gimp-2.2.x and old GIMP-GAP version)
   + ... Full Supported, and passed simple "Apply Varying" Test OK
              (78 procedures)
   # ... Partly Supported, Apply constant OK, 
              but Apply Varying not possible or does not make sense
              (18 procedures)
   - ... NOT supported (Failed Test)
   : ... Not supported (support would make no sense)
   . ... not tested

Additional notes:

(1)   the pagecurl plugin fails when called via
           <image>/Filters/Filter all Layers
      because it adds an extra layer for the curl to the image.
      
      pagecurl can be used as filter when called via
           <image>/Video/Frames Modify
      when Function: "Apply filter on layers" is selected as action.
      
      From my point of view it does not make much sense
      in animations,
      because this plugin works with fixed curling amount.

(2)   This plugin works with curves files of the old fileformat (written by GIMP 1.2 up to 2.4)
      and now also accepts the new fileformat introduced with GIMP curves tool settings of the GIMP-2.6 release.
      The GIMP curves tool of the 2.6 release supports reading both formats.
      The parser in the GIMP-GAP specific wrapper was updated to support
      both fileformats too.


plug_in_map_object old Testreport: (did not verfy that at the latest test)
   
   - The MapObject has an implicite feature:
     If the handled layer has NO ALPHA Channel (as backgrounds often do)
     and the "Transparent background" is ON
     it forces the creation of a new image.
     (regardless if the "Create new image" option is on or not)

     It took me hours to find out about that feature
     that looks more like a bug to me.
     I would prefere to add the alpha channel in such a case.
     
     If you want to do animated calls to MapObject ("Apply Varying" Button)
     please make sure that the background layer has an Alphachannel
     (Open Layers & Channels dialog, and "Add Apha Channel"
      to the bg layer)

  - If you call MapObject a 2nd time in the same gimp session
    gimp reports errors if one of the drawables (that were used
    in the 1.st call) has become invalid.
