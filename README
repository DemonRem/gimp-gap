This is an unstable developers version 2.3.0 of the GIMP Video menu.

The GIMP-GAP (GIMP Animation Package) is a collection of Plug-Ins
to extend the GIMP with capabilities to edit and create
Animations as sequences of single frames.


Requires:
=========
 - gimp 2.2 or higher.
     This release was tested with gimp-2.2.11
     
     Note: GIMP-GAP provides some features that are able to call many of the
           GIMP standard filters. (plug-in programs that are shiped with 
           gimp-2.2.11) Those features depend on the tested PDB interface
           versions and may fail if newer version are used.

 - glib 2.8 or higher.

 - For full video encoding and decoding support
   check also the requirements for ffmpeg and libmpeg3.
   
   ffmpeg and libmpeg3 are included as sourcecode tarball in this
   GIMP-GAP distribution.
   
   - nasm  and the old gcc 3.3 version 
           are required only in case when compiling of the
           (optional) libmpeg3 is desired.
           (nasm for the .asm sources)
   
   see file extern_libs/README_extern_libs for further information
   about those libs.    
 

 Optional libs for decode/encode videofiles:

 - xvid       1.0.2
                   The free XVID Codec is used for MPEG4 encoding
		   with the gimp-gap AVI fileformat encoding plug-in.
		   (the FFMPEG libs have built in MPEG4 support
		   and do not depend on XVID Codec)
		 
		   You can get the xvid codec at:
		       http://www.xvid.org/downloads.html

Feature specific details are documented the files

Additional Installation Notes
=============================

This GIMP-GAP release includes sourcecode tarballs of
external libraries :

- ffmpeg
- libmpeg3

Those libs are built automatically.
Configuration options for those libs can be set by editing the
files:

  extern_libs/configure_options_ffmpeg.txt
  extern_libs/configure_options_libmpeg3.txt

Those configure_option files are read by the master .configure script


Installation:

  ./autogen.sh   # includes the ./configure call
  make
  make install






A correct installation adds the follwing menu trees to the GIMP:
  <Image>/Video
  <Xtns>/Split Video to Frames
  
An overview of all menus can be found at
docs/reference/txt/INTRODUCTION.txt    

For the generic installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.


Additional notes:
  This version of GIMP-GAP is a separated Package since GIMP-1.3.x
  and does not compile/run with GIMP-1.2.x or older GIMP versions than 2.2.


Notes:
======
   
   - GIMP 1.1.4 upto GIMP-1.2.x have included older versions of GIMP-GAP 
     as standard plug-in (named gap) with no need of extra installation.


   - GIMP-GAP provides frontend dialogs for:
      - mplayer 1.0
      - xanim 2.80.1 exporting edition (with the extensions from loki
        entertainment)
      - mpeg_encode (V1.5R2)
      - mpeg2encode (V1.2)
      

     The frontends and the external programs need UNIX environment to run.
     The programs mpeg2encode, mpeg_encode, and xanim
     are old and you may not need them at all since GIMP-GAP-2.2
     provides improved alternatives for all of them.
     
     But it is higly recommanded to install the program mplayer.
     MPlayer does support very much videofileformats.
     
     
     If you like to use that stuff, you should install
       mplayer
       xanim 2.80.1 (loki)
       mpeg_encode and mpeg_play
       mpeg2encode and mpeg2decode
     on your system.

   - The GIMP-GAP playback module provides audiosupport for audiofiles
     in RIFF WAV format.  The audiosupport is based on wavplay (tested
     with version 1.4).
     
     If you want to have audiosupport you must install wavplay
     and configure and compile gimp-gap without the
     configure option --disable-audiosupport
     
     As far as i know, wavplay is available only for LINUX, but i may
     be wrong..
     
     The GIMP-GAP playback module further provides a button for converting
     other audiofile formats to RIFF WAV.
     If you want to use that feature the external following programs
     must be installed:
      - sox
      - lame
     
   - There is no need to install all those external programs to
     compile GIMP-GAP.

Other known Bugs
================

- some mpeg videos do crash at read attempt.
  libmpeg3 1.5.4  has problems in its CLOSE procedure on those
  videos.
  The GVA API has a built in workaround for UNIX operating systems
  and automatically use the libavformat based decoder in such a case
  (with a little run-time penalty at opening)
  
  for more details see docs/reference/txt/gap_gimprc_params.txt
    (video-workaround-for-libmpeg3-close-bug "no")

  you can produce such problem videos
  with the ffmpeg encoder, 
  and with "MPEG1 high quality" preset in the GIMP-GAP Master Encoder dialog
  


Have fun,
