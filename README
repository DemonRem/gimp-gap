This is a prerelease version 2.1.0 of the GIMP Video menu.

The GIMP-GAP (GIMP Animation Package) is a collection of Plug-Ins
to extend the GIMP with capabilities to edit and create
Animations as sequences of single frames.


Requires:
=========
 - gimp 2.0.0 or higher (stable release)

 Optional libs for decode/encode videofiles:

 - ffmpeg     0.4.8 (libavformat 0.4.8 and libavcodec 0.4.8)
                    libavformat and libavcodec build up the basic
		    videofile support for many MPEG based fileformats
		    both for read and write access 
		    (decode and encode video and audio).
		    
		    You can get ffmpeg at:
		       http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net
		       
		    Please install FFMPEG's libraries
		     - libavformat
		     - libavcodec
		    that are needed for linking with the Gimp Video API

		    To install those libs you must use the configure option

		     --enable-shared   

		    (that is normally OFF by default)


		    cd ffmpeg
		    ./configure --enable-shared --disable-mmx --enable-a52
		       
		    
		    If you want create videos with gimp-gap
		    you should install those libs
		    and configure gimp-gap with
		    
		    --enable_gva_libavformat
		    
 - libmpeg3   1.5.4
                    libmpeg3 is an additional library for
		    reading (decode) frames and audio from MPEG files
		    (VCD, DVD)
		    You can get libmpeg3 at:
		        http://www.heroinewarrior.com/download.php3
			
		    Note: the original has no installation support,
		    you may prefere libmpeg3 rpm packages provided by SuSE
		    or other LINUX distributors.
		    
		    To install the original, you must firts compile the library 
		    (see the included docs and Makefile).
		    Then copy all header files
		    to /usr/local/include and the library to /usr/local/lib.
		    
		    mkdir /usr/local/include/libmpeg3
		    mkdir /usr/local/include/libmpeg3/audio
		    mkdir /usr/local/include/libmpeg3/video
		    
		    cd libmpeg3  # the directory that was created by extracting the tarball
                    cp *.h  	  /usr/local/include/libmpeg3
		    cp audio/*.h  /usr/local/include/libmpeg3/audio
		    cp video/*.h  /usr/local/include/libmpeg3/video	    
		    
		    # copy the lib (directory i686 depends on machine architecture)
		    cp i686/libmpeg3.a /usr/local/lib
		    
		    
		    
		    If you want to extract frames form DVD typical .IFO
		    files you should install libmpeg3 and configure
		    gimp-gap with 

		    -- enable_gva_libmpeg3
		    
 - xvid       1.0.0
                   The free XVID Codec is used for MPEG4 encoding
		   with the gimp-gap AVI fileformat encoding plug-in.
		   (the FFMPEG libs have built in MPEG4 support
		   and do not depend on XVID Codec)
		 
		   You can get the xvid codec at:
		       http://www.xvid.org/downloads.html
