Video Configuration (gimprc)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are optional configuration values for the GIMP-GAP video plug-ins.
Those values are stored in your personal gimprc file (located in $HOME/.gimp-2.2/gimprc)
or in the system-wide gimprc file (usually located at /usr/local/etc/gimp/2.2/gimprc)

If you edit gimprc files by hand, you must do this before you startup GIMP.


# configure where to find the executable mplayer program.
# use the full name including the absolute path. 
# This is required if mplayer is NOT found in one of the directories
# specified in PATH but is installed somewhere else.
# (relevant only on UNIX systems)
(mplayer_prog "/usr/local/bin/mplayer")

# configure where to find the executable wavplay program.
# use the full name including the absolute path. 
# This is required if wavplay is NOT found in one of the directories
# specified in PATH but is installed somewhere else.
# (relevant only on UNIX systems)
(wavplay_prog "/usr/X11R6/bin/wavplay")


# there are 2 Values to define direcory and basename
# for Video Copy/Cut/Paste operations      
(video-paste-dir "/home/hof/gap_video_paste_dir")
(video-paste-basename "gap_video_paste_")

# the video-confirm-frame-delete can have values "yes" or "no"
# where "no" does not show the confirm dialog windows when the user
# tries to delete video frames of the video.
# (default is "yes")
(video-confirm-frame-delete "yes")


# the gap video API keeps an internal cache for
# the specified number of frames at read access from
# videofiles.
(video-max-frames-keep-cached 500)



# videoindexes are files that store seekoffsets for keyframes
# and enable fast and frame exact random access to frames in a videofile.
# if gimp-gap should create such files automatically when needed
# you should configure the value "yes".
# if you want gimp-gap to ask each time before creating videoindex file
# then configure value "ask"
# (ask is the default when nothing is configured)
# if gimp-gap should not create such videoindex files at all
# configure value "no"
(video-index-creation "ask")

# configure where to store and check for video index files
# if video-index-dir is not configured
# the GAP video API uses a directory named gvaindexes
# in your gimpdirectory by default
(video-index-dir "/path/to/writeable/directory")


# optional external audioconverter program
# must be able to handle the same parameters as the
# standard converter script audioconvert_to_wav.sh
# There is NO need for the audioconvert_program gimprc configuration
# if you use the standard converter script.
(audioconvert_program "/usr/local/bin/my_private_audioconverter")


# NON-XCF frame save behaviour:
# -----------------------------
# if you want to use GIMP-GAP with other fileformats than XCF
# for your frames, you will get a warning dialog at the first
# attempt (per GIMP-session) to save one of the frames with GIMP-GAP plug-ins.
# If you dont want this warning dialog, you can use the gimprc
# file to configure how GIMP-GAP should save frames depending on the
# extension. 
# for all configured fileformat extensions GIMP-GAP uses the configuration from the
# gimprc file and does not show the warning dialog.
# Here are recommanded gimprc configuration settings
# for some common used fileformats:

(video-save-flattened-jpg    "yes")
(video-save-flattened-jpeg   "yes")
(video-save-flattened-bmp    "yes")
(video-save-flattened-png    "yes")
(video-save-flattened-ppm    "yes")
(video-save-flattened-xjt    "no")
(video-save-flattened-gif    "no")
