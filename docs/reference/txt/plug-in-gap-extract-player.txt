"plug-in-gap-extract-player"


Player invoked from videoextract plug-in


  The player is titled as "Select Videorange" in this case, because
  it operates as visual range selection tool here.

  The selected range in the player is linked with the selected range
  in the "Input Video selection" section.
  The range is specified by the spinbuttons "From Frame" and "To Frame".
  Changes of the range in the players range are immediate propagated
  to the range in the "Input Video selection" section, that is
  relevant for extracting frames.
  Note: This is an unidirectional link. 
        Changes in the "Input Video selection" section are not
	propagated to the players range.

  (the player hides the HELP Button in case when
   invoked from the videoextract as part of the "Extract Video" window
   because this window has its own help button.
   But the HELP button is shown when the player is invoked as separate window)
