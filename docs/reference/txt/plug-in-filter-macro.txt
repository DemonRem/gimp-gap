"plug-in-filter-macro"

Filtermacro Script:

    Start from Menu:

      "<Image>/Filters/Filtermacro"

    WARNINGS:
    - fltermacro scripts are a temporary solution. Support may be removed
      in future releases of gimp-gap. 
    - filtermacros are restricted to plug-ins that are able to run with LAST_VALUES.
    - filtermacro scriptfiles are machine dependent, plug-in version dependent, 
      and may not work in the expected way or even crash at execution on other machines
      or on execution with newer versions of the recorded filter plug-ins.

  Filename:
    Name of the filtermacro scriptfile.

  Delete All button:
    Delete the filtermacro scriptfile.

  Delete button:
    Delete the currently selected filtercall from the filtermacro scriptfile.

  Add
    Add a new filtercall to the filtermacro scriptfile.
    This button opens a PDB browser dialog window,
    where you can select filters that have been already used
    within the current GIMP-session.
    The PDB browser will show only filters that can
    operate on a drawable and have stored the parameters
    of the last run (in the current Session)

  Cancel
    Close the window without any further action.

  OK
    Close the window and apply all the filtercalls
    that are listed in the filtermacro scriptfile
    with their recorded parameters to the
    current drawable.
    (this is the drawable from where the 'Filter Macro' dialog
    was invoked from)


  Tip:
  Filtermacro execution can be used in the same way as a single
  filtercall, together with the
    'Filter All Layers'  and the 
    'Frames Modify'      
  features of gimp-gap. This way you can apply a set of filtercalls
  on all layers of a multilyer image
  (or on all selected layers in multiple frames)
  at once
