Resize Video Frames

    Start from Menu:
             <Image>/Video/Frames Resize
	     
    With the video resize feature you can change the canvas size for 
    all frame images in a sequence of numbered frames.
    Load one of the frames and invoke this plug-in from the loaded frame,
    adjust the settings as you like and the plug-in will
    apply the new canvas size to all other frames when OK is pressed.
    
    Current width and height are displayed as information.
    With "New Width" and  "New Height" you can specify the
    desired new size in pixels.
    
    When the "Reset" button is pressed, the new width and 
    new height values are reset to current values.
    
    With X/Y ratio values you can specify new size as factor.
    A value of 2 gives double size, 0.5 half size.
    
    The chain button keeps canvas proportions constant when active.
    With inactive chain button (symbol changes to broken chain)
    width and height may be changed independent.
    
Offset
    X and Y offset values (in pixels) for placing the
    image within the new canvas size.
    there are buttons for independent centering horizontal and vertical.

    There is also a visual control widget where you can
    arrange the position of the image on the new canvas size
    via dragging with the mouse and updates the offsets
    according to the desired position.
