"plug-in-name2layer"                  

Render Filename to Layer

  Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Filename to Layer...

  This plug-in renders the filename of the image
  or just the number part of the filename onto the image.
  If the parameter create_new_layer is 0, the filename is rendered 
  to the active drawable (the layer that was active when
  this plug-in was invoked).
  Otherwise a new textlayer is created.
  
  Mode:
    "Number Only"     ... render just the number part
    "Filename"        ... render the filename without directory path
    "Path/Filename"   ... render the filename including the directory path
    
  Fontname:
    Entry for the Fontname
    
  Fontsize:
    Fontsize in pixels
    
  X:
    Position x offset in pixels
    
  Y:
    Position y offset in pixels
    
  Antialias:
    ON: Use Antialiasing
    OFF: No Antialiasing
    
  Create Layer:
    ON: Create a new layer,
    OFF: Render on the active drawable


  Tip:
  To create framenumbers in all of your frames
  you can use the "Modify Frames" (<Image>/Video/Frames Modify) feature
  and choose "Apply filter on Layer(s)" as function.
  In the next dialog step, the GIMP-GAP DB-Browser window
  select "plug_in_gap_renumber" as filter name.
  (this is the internal PDB-Name of the "Render Filename to Layer" plug-in)
  
  Then choose "Apply constant" in the DB-Browser window.
  This should open the "Render Filename to Layer" dialog window
  (only for the first frame) where you can adjust the settings.
  Choose "Number Only" mode for rendering only the framenumber part,
  and "Create Layer" checkbutton turned on if you want the number to be created
  as separate layer.
  With "Create Layer" turned off the number will be rendered on (all)
  the layer(s) that were selected in the initial "Modify Frames" dialog window.
