MPEG2 Encode

    Start from Menu:
        <Image>/Video/Encode/MPEG2...

    Encode frames as MPEG2 or MPEG2 videofile.    
    This feature is only available on UNIX systems and is 
    a frontend for the videoencoder mpeg2encode 1.2
    (MPEG Software Simulation Group)
	   
	   Web:      http://www.mpeg.org/MSSG
	   FTP:      ftp://ftp.mpeg.org/pub/mpeg/mssg
	   E-mail:   mssg@mpeg.org  (author contact)

    For operation mpeg2encode 1.2 must be installed on your system
    at runtime.
    
    Warning:
      this is old software. 
      You may want to use the Master Videoencoder instead.

    Limits:
      Your frames must be stored in PPM image fileformat.
      There is no support for storyboard based encoding
      and /or filtermacros at encoding time.
      There is no audiosupport.
      

   FromFrame:
   ToFrame:
     Here you can specify the range of frames that should
     be included in the resulting MPEG encoded videofile.

   Framerate:
     The framerate in frames per second.
     
   Bitrate:
     Bitrate value.

   MPEG-type
     Radio button to select MPEG1 or MPEG2 type.
     
   Videoformat:
     Combo box to select videonorm (NTSC, PAL or SECAM)


   Outputfile:
     Name of the resulting MPEG videofile.

   GenParams
    this button generates a shellscript (using UNIX bourne shell syntax)
    with the required calls to run the external mpeg encoder program.
    An additional Parameterfile is generated along with the shellscript.
    It contains the parameter settings that are required to call the
    external mpeg encoder program and is referred in the generated
    shellscript.
    
    The generated shellscript is written to the filename specified by
    the "Startscript" entry.
    The entry "Parameterfile:"  specifies the name of the parameterfile.
    
   Gen + Encode
    this button does the same as "GenParams" but also starts
    the generated script.    

To prepare for MPEG encoding:
     
 - Use 'Frames Convert' from the video menu 
   to convert your video frames to .ppm 
   (or another fileformat that can be read directly by
    your encoder)
      
 - If you have a layerstack-animated multilayer image
   you can use 'Split Img to Frames' from the video menu.
          
 - Then use 'Encode/MPEG2..' 
   from the video menu.
   (Invoked from one of the prepared video frames)
	   
   The encoder offers a lot of parameter settings for the experienced
   User. The parameters are passed to the encoder in a parameterfile.
   
   The frontend dialog shows only the most important parameters,
   but generates a documented parameterfile with default values
   for the other parameters.
   You can generate the parameterfile with or without starting
   the encoder.
   (You may start the encoder later by executing the startscript
    from a Unixshell. The startscript is generated by the frontend dialog)

   For more information on the parameters please refer to the encoders
   documentation.
