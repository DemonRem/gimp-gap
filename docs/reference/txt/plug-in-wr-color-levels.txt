"plug-in-wr-color-levels"

Color Levels

    Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Layer/Colors/Levels
       
       for automated apply, this filter is started
       indirect via the menus:
	<Image>/Filters/Filter all Layers   or
        <Image>/Video/Frames Modify

       when its internal PDB-name:
 
           "plug_in_wr_color_levels"
	   
       is selected as filter name.

    This color levels dialog works the same way
    as the color levels tool that can be found in the menu:
     Layer/Colors/Levels

    but has a less comfortable dialog without preview.

    The advantage of this variante is the ability
    to run automatically on many layers or frames
    with constant value settings or as animated filter 
    with varying value settings in combination with 
    the GIMP-GAP plug-ins:

       "Filter All Layer"
       "Modify Layers"
