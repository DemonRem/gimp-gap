    This plug-in provides metamorphose transformation and
    warp deformations, depending on the selected render mode.
   
    Warning: this plug-in is still in experimental state.
             it may change in future releases.    

Morphing:
    Morphing takes a source layer and a destination layer
    as input and creates the steps inbetween (as newly added layers)
    to transform the source layer into the destination layer.
    
    
    The warp transformation is controlled by a set of movement vectors. 
    A movement vector is shown in form of 2 corrensponding points
    (start point in the source layer, the corresponding
    end point in the destination layer)
    When the checkbutton "lines" is ON, vectors are displayed as lines
    in the destination layer.

    Points are created via mouse click in the source or destination
    layer preview and can be picked and dragged with the mouse.
