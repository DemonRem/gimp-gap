Frames to Image
    Start from Menu:
       <image>/Video/Frames to Image

    Convert frames to one multilayered image.
          
    The selected source range of frames is copied into one
    new created multilayered destination Image.
    Each frame results in one layer in the destination image.
    (or nothing if the source frame has no selected layer)
    
    With the layer basename you can choose a name for the resulting
    layers in the destination Image. The string [####] is replaced
    by the frame number. 
       Example: my_layer_[##]  results in: my_layer_01, my_layer_02 .... 
    
    Layer Mergemode:
      - Extend as necessary   Build a destination layer by merging
                              selected layers of one source frame.
                              The destination layer's size will be
                              the outline-rectangle of all selected
                              layers.
                              
      - Clipped to image      Build a destination layer by merging 
                              selected layers of one source frame.
                              The destination layer's size will be
                              the image size.
                              
      - Clipped to bottom layer  Build a destination layer by merging
                              selected layers of one sourceframe.
                              The destination layer's size will be
                              the size of the lowest selected layer.
                              
      - Flattened image       Build destination layer by flattening
                              the source layers copied from one source frame.
                              There will be no transparent parts
                              in the destination layers.
                              The destination layer's size will be
                              the image size.
    
    With the 'Exclude BG-Layer' checkbutton pressed,
    the background layers of all the source frames are excluded
    from the copy, regardless if they are selected or not.
    Otherwise background layers are handled like all other layers.
   
    (If you are using flatten mode 'Flatten' the background color will fill all
     transparent parts of the resulting destination layer(s).)

    Layer Selection:
    ----------------
    Here you can select which layer(s) of a frame is(are) used
    to build the destination layer.
    
    Select Layer(s):
       Pattern is equal to layer name
       Pattern is start of layer name
       Pattern is end of layer name
       Pattern is a part of layer name
           With these settings you can select layers
           by their layername.
           (All layers with a layer name matching the select pattern
           are selected).
        
       Pattern is layerstack number list
           Layers are selected by their layerstack position,
           where 0 is the top layer.
           The pattern is a list of layerstack numbers or
           number ranges. (0-3 matches to the upper 4 layers)       
       Pattern is reverse-stack list"
           Here you can specify layerstack numbers in reverse order.
           (where 0 is the background layer)
           
       All Visible (ignore pattern)
           All visible layers are selected.
           (The select pattern is ignored)
       
    Select Pattern:
       String to identify a layer. It can be a part of the layer name
       or a list of layerstack numbers (like this one: "0, 2-5, 9")
       depending on your choice in select layer(s) above.
    Case Sensitive:
       Lowercase and upppercase letters are considered as equal
       if this checkbutton is set to off.
    Invert Selection:
       Select all unselected layers.
    Pixel Selection:
       How to handle selected areas in the handled frame range.
       "Ignore"
           Ignore all selections in all handled frames
       "Initial Frame"
           Use only one selection from the first handled frame,
           All unselected areas are set to transparent in the
           resulting multilayer image.
           All the resulting layers in the generated multilayer image
           are shaped by the initial selection.
       "Frame specific"
           Use selections from all handled frames.
           (Frames without any selection are handled as if all pixels were selected)
           All unselected areas are set to transparent in the
           resulting multilayer image.
