"plug-in-wr-curves"

Apply Color Curves File

    Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Layer/Colors/CurvesFile
       
       for automated apply, this filter is started
       indirect via the menus:
	<Image>/Filters/Filter all Layers   or
        <Image>/Video/Frames Modify

       when its internal PDB-name:
 
           "plug_in_wr_curves"
	   
       is selected as filter name.

    This curves file dialog works the same way
    as the color curves tool that can be found in the menu:
     Layer/Colors/Curves)

    but has no graphical dialog for editing
    the color curve settings.
    It needs a color curves file as input.

    The advantage of this variant is the ability
    to run automatically on many layers or frames
    with constant value settings or as animated filter 
    with varying value settings in combination with 
    the GIMP-GAP plug-ins:

       "Filter All Layer"
       "Modify Layers"

    For applying this filter with varying values you need 2
    color curves file and provide them as input for the
    first and last handled layer. All the
    layers inbetween will be automatically handled with
    slightly varying the color curve settings from
    the start color curve to the end color curve.
