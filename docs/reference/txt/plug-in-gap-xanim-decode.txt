XANIM based extract

    Start from Menu:
	<Image>/Video/Split Video to Frames/XANIM based extract
        <Toolbox>/Xtns/Split Video to Frames/XANIM based extract

    WARNING:
    This feature is deprecated, because XANIM is old unmaintained software.
    If you still have XANIM 2.80 exporting edition it may still work.
    If not it is not worth to make efforts to get it working
    because GIMP-GAP has frontend support for MPLayer and built-in
    support for video extract based on FFMPEG / libmpeg3.


    Extract frames and/or audio from a videofile.    
    This feature is only available on UNIX systems and is 
    a frontend for the xanim player.

    For that feature GIMP-GAP must be configured and compiled 
    with the configure option:
        --enable-unix-frontends
 
    Further it is required that xanim is installed on your system
    at run time.
    (GIMP_GAP was tested with xanim-2.80 exporting edition).

  Video:
    Here you can enter the name of an input videofile.
    The "..." button opens a filebrowser popup dialog
    where you can select a filename.
 
  From Frame:
    Framenumber of the 1.st frame to extract.
    
  To Frame:
    Framenumber of the last frame to extract.

  Framenames:
    Basenamepart for the extracted frames to write.
    The 6-digit numberpart and the extension (.ppm, .jpeg .xcf)
    are added for each extracted frame.
       
  
  Format:
    Imagefileformat for the extracted frames.
      JPEG
      PPM
      XCF
      
    Note: XCF fileformat is not directly supported by xanim.
          In this case the ectracted frames are created in PPM
	  imagefileformat and converted to the GIMP's native 
	  XCF fileformat automatically.

  Extract Frames:
    ON: extract frames.
    OFF: dont extract frames.
    
  Extract Audio:
    ON: extract audiopart.
    OFF: dont extract audiopart if there is one.
    
  Jpeg Quality:
    Quality of the frames where 100 is best quality (but largest filesize)

  Open:
    Open the 1.st extracted frame when extracting is done.
    
  Asynchron:
    xanim is not able to start extracting at the specified "From Frame"
    offset. Therefore this frontend automatically deletes unwanted frames
    that are extracted by xanim per default.
    
    ON: Run xanim as asynchron process and try to delete unwanted
        frames while xanim is running and kill the xanim process
	after the last wanted "To Frame" framenumber was extracted.

    OFF: call xanim as synchron process
        and delete unwanted frames when xanim process has finished.
