Crop Video Frames

    Start from Menu:
             <Image>/Video/Frames Crop
	     
    With the video crop feature you can crop 
    all frame images in a sequence of numbered frames.
    Load one of the frames and invoke this plug-in from the loaded frame,
    adjust the settings as you like and the plug-in will
    crop all other frames downto the selected size when OK is pressed.
    (the parts of the frames outside the cropping rectangles are
    will be lost after this operation)
    
    Current width and height are displayed as information.
    With "New Width" and  "New Height" you can specify the
    desired new size in pixels.
    
    When the "Reset" button is pressed, the new width and 
    new height values are reset to current values.
    
    With X/Y ratio values you can specify new size as factor,
    A value of 0.5 crops down to half size.
    
    The chain button keeps image proportions constant when active.
    With inactive chain button (symbol changes to broken chain)
    width and height may be changed independent.
    
Offset
    X and Y offset values (in pixels) for placing the
    image within the new canvas size.
    there are buttons for independent centering horizontal and vertical.

    There is also a visual control widget where you can
    arrange the position of the current image size within
    the new image size via dragging with the mouse.
    This updates the offsets according to the desired position.
    The new (reduced) image size is shown as smaller black
    outlined rectangle.
