Extract Videorange

  Start from Menu:
     <Image>/Video/Split Video to Frames/Extract Videorange


  The extract videorange dialog provides features
  to extract a selected range of frames 
  and/or audio from a videofile. It offers frame exact positioning
  and visual controlled range picking.
  
Input Video Selection:

  The widgets in this area are used to specify
  the source videofile.
  

  Videofilename entry:
    Here you can enter the name of your source videofile.

    Some of the common used videofileformats are
    supported. Typical extensions for videofiles are
       .avi
       .mov
       .mpg
       .mpeg
       .vob
       .ifo
      
    For a detailed list of supported videofileformats / codecs
    see ffmpeg and libmpeg3 documentation. 

  From Frame:
  To Frame:
    Here you can specify the range of frames that
    should be extracted.
    
    If you want to extract all frames of the video
    and dont know the total number of frames,
    use 999999 in the "To Frame" widget.
    
    The "Video Range" button opens a playback
    preview where you can view the video and
    set the range under visual control.
  
  Videotrack:
    Here you can select the video track,
    if the specified videofile has more than one 
    videotrack.
    (such as multiangle DVD stuff)
    
    Select videotrack 0 to ignore video.
    (in this case no frames are extracted)

  Audiotrack:
    Here you can select the audio track,
    if the specified videofile has more than one 
    audiotrack.
    (such as multilingual DVD stuff)
    
    Select audiotrack 0 to ignore audio.
    (in this case no audiodata is extracted)


  
  Decoder:
    In this widget you can specify a preferred
    videodecoder.
    Use one of the values
    "(none, automatic)"
    "libavformat"
    "libmpeg3"
    provided in the combo-box to the right.
    
    Normally you dont need this widget.
    But some videofiles may cause problems
    (even crashes at open attempt)
    with one of the decoders.
    In such cases it could help to set
    another decoder that may be able
    to read the same videofile.
    
    In case where the specified decoder does not
    recognize your videofile as supported
    fileformat, another decoders will be tried
    automatically.    
    
    If a compatible decoder for the videofile was found
    its name is displayed as the Active Decoder.

  Aspect Ratio:
    Displays the aspect ratio information of the frames in the videofile.
    Aspect Ratio is defined as width / height. 
    Commonly used aspect ratio values (4:3) or (16:9) will be detected
    and shown as additional information to the ratio value.

    If the videofile contains no aspect ratio information,
    or the active decoder is not able to access this information
    the string "unknown" is displayed instead of the ratio value.
    (libavformat works well, libmpeg3 does not recognize the aspect ratio)
    

Output:

  Mode:
    If the "Create only one multilayer image"
    checkbutton is ON
    only one GIMP-Image will be created in RAM.
    All the extracted frames are added as layers
    to this newly created image.
    
    (Dont use this option if you want extract
    a huge amount of frames)
    
    In the other mode (OFF) the extracted frames
    are written as sequence of numered frame
    images in GIMP-GAP typical style.
    
    The Name of those frame images is controlled
    by the entry widgets:
    
      Basename
      Digits
      Extension
    
    where the digits control how many digits to use
    for the framenumber part and the extension
    does automatically define the image fileformat.



  Framenr 1:
    Here you can specify the framenumberpart
    for the 1.st extracted frame.
    A value of 0 will use the original framenumber
    of the input video.
    
    
  Deinterlace:
    The frame extraction has a built in deinterlace filter.
    Interlaced frames are built up of 2 half pictures,
    where the even lines build the one half and the odd lines
    build the other half picture.
    The deinterlace filter builds the extracted frame
    by picking only the lines of one of the half pictures
    and replaceng the lines of the other half picture
    by more or less smooth mixing the upper and lower neighbour lines.
    The mix is controlled with the spinbutton value
    where 1.0 is a smooth mix, and 0.0 takes just one of the
    neighbour lines without mixing.
    That way the deinterlaced frames have same height as the
    originals.

    The Deinterlace combo-box options are:
    
    "no deinterlace"
        Turn off the deinterlace filter and extract frames
        1:1 as they were read from the videofile.
    
    "deinterlace (odd lines only)"
        Extract the half-picture that is represented by odd lines
    "deinterlace (even lines only)"   
        Extract the half-picture that is represented by even lines
    "deinterlace frames x 2 (odd 1st)"
        Extract both half-pictures starting with the odd one.
        1 frames in the video gives 2 frame images on disc in that case.
    "deinterlace frames x 2 (even 1st)"
        Extract both half-pictures starting with the even one.
        1 frames in the video gives 2 frame images on disc in that case.
        
    
  Audiofile:
    The filename for the extracted audiodata.
    Audiodata is always written in RIFF WAVE Fileformat.
