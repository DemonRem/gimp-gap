VCR Navigator

   Start from menu:
     <Image>/Video/VCR Navigator

   The VCR Navigator dialog shows a thumbnail view, frame_number and
   time (mm:ss:msec) of the frames in a scrollable listbox.

   AL-Tracking:
     Tracking of the active layer can enhance the workflow
     when stepping from frame to frame. This feature tries
     to find a layer in the newly loaded frame that matches
     with the active layer of the previously
     displayed frame (by name or stackposition) and set the
     active layer to that matching layer automatically.

     Radio buttons 
     "OFF"   ... disable tracking of active layer
     "Name"  ... enable tracking of active layer by name.
                 Layernames are compared from left to right
		 and the layer whith the most matching 
		 layername characters is selected.
		 If there are more layers with same amount of matching chars
		 case sensitivity, stringlength and stackposition are taken
		 into account too.
     "Pos"   ... enable tracking of active layer by stackposition
                 where positions of onionskin layers are not counted.

   framerate:
     You can set the global framerate for all frames here.

     Note: changing the framerate in the VCR Naviagtor
            dialog window does not change the number of frames.
            Therefore the motion does speed up or slow down
            at playback. If you want to keep your motion
            speed constant at increased framerate use the
            "Frames Density" tool to create (or delete)
	    the requested additional frames.

   timezoom:
     with timezoom you tell the VCR Navigator dialog window
     to display every n-th frame only, to get an overview
     if there are many frames.

     Framerate and timezoom values are stored in
      a gap video info file named:
      <framebasename>_vin.gap

   Double click with left mousebutton on a frame in the listbox
   performs a goto operation, which loads the clicked
   frame as current frame.

   Single click with left mousebutton
      selecets one frame (deselecting all others)
   Ctrl  click with left mousebutton
      selecets one frame (additional to the current selection)
   Shift click with left mousebutton
      selects a range of frames.

   Click with right mousebutton
     brings up a pop-up menu

   Pop-up menu
      copy,
      cut
      paste before
      paste after
      paste replace
      clear pastebuffer
      select all
      select none

      cut and copy
         is sensitive if any frame is selected,
      paste and clear pastebuffer
         is sensitive if video paste buffer contains
	 at least one frame.

      This menu enables you to cut, copy and paste the selected
      frames even between different videos.
      Size and type of the handled frames are converted at pasting
      if needed.
      The palette of the current frame is used for the
      pasted frames when the destination type is INDEXED.

      There are 3 types of paste:
        before:
	   Insert frames before the current frame.
	   Use this mode if you want to insert frames
	   before the first frame.
	after:
	   Insert frames after the current frame.
	   Use this mode if you want to insert frames
	   after the last frame.
	replace:
	   Replace frames beginning at the current frame
	   with the frames from the video paste buffer,
	   and does overwrite existing frames.

      If there are selected frames in the VCR Navigator
      dialog window, the current frame is set to
      the first selected frame and the paste opration
      is releted to the first selected frame

      The paste buffer is located in the filesystem
      and can be configured in the gimprc file:

       (video-paste-dir "/home/hof/gap_video_paste_dir")
       (video-paste-basename "gap_video_paste_")

    The duplicate button in the VCR Navigator dialog
    duplicates the selected frames immediate into
    the current video, without writing to the
    video paste buffer.

    The delete button in the VCR Navigator dialog
    deletes the selected frames without writing to the
    video paste buffer.

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
       There is no undo for GIMP-GAP operations,
       and the deleted frames can not be restored.
