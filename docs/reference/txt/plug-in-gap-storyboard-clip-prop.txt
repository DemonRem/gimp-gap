Clip Properties (Storyboard)

    The clip properties dialog window is used to
    create new clips and to view and update properties
    of existing clips in a storyboard file.
    It is a popup dialog of the storyboard editor

    ## refere to Storyboard Dialog
    ## (plug-in-gap-storyboard-edit.txt)

    File:
      Clips use a filename to refere to a videofile or to 
      a frame imagefile on disk.
      The button "..." opens a filebrowser dialog window
      where you can select the filename.

      The Clip Type is detected automatically (depending on the file) as:
	MOVIE
	FRAME-IMAGES
	SINGLE-IMAGE

    From:
    To:
      Here you can enter the selected frame range for the clip.
      (those widgets are disabled when file referes to a single image)
      
    Loops:
      Here you can specify the number of loops, where a value of 2
      shows the selected range of frames two times in a loop.
 
    Pingpong:
      The Pingpong checkbutton plays the selected range forward
      and backwards.
      If the selected range is from 1 to 5
      the clip is played as sequence  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2
      
    Stepsize:
      With the stepsize density you can affect the playback speed
      individual per clip without changing the master framerate
      of the storyboard file.
      Values greater than one results in skipping input frames
      and will speed up the clip.
      Values less than one does show some frames twice
      and does slow down the clip.
      
      For normal playback of the clip use stepsize value 1.0.      
      
      
    Videotrack:
      Here you can select the number of the input videotrack.
      Most videos have just one track.
      Some DVD videos have multiple angle view where the different
      angles are represented by 2 or more videotracks.
      Note: 
        the videotrack is only available for clip type MOVIE.
    
    Deinterlace:
      Deinterlacing is selected via radio buttons.
      Fetching frames out of already encoded videofiles
      has a built in deinterlace filter.
      Interlaced frames are built up of 2 half pictures,
      where the even lines build the one half and the odd lines
      build the other half picture.
      The deinterlace filter builds the extracted frame
      by picking only the lines of one of the half pictures
      and replaceng the lines of the other half picture
      by more or less smooth mixing the upper and lower neighbour lines.
      The mix is controlled with the spinbutton value
      where 1.0 is a smooth mix, and 0.0 takes just one of the
      neighbour lines without mixing.
      That way the deinterlaced frames have same height as the
      originals.
      
      The deinterlace radio buttons are:
    
      "None"
          Turn off the deinterlace filter and read frames
          1:1 as they are found in the videofile.

      "Odd"
          Extract the half-picture that is represented by odd lines
      "Even"
          Extract the half-picture that is represented by even lines
	
      Note: 
        the deinterlace filter is only available for clip type
        MOVIE.

    Duration:
      Information about the duration of the clip in frames
      and playtime in format mm:ss:msec
      
    Comment:
      An optional comment text on the clip.

Find Scene End
    This button checks the frames in the defined range
    between "From" and "To" for significant changes
    and sets the "To" value to the first detected scene change.
    
Auto Scene Split
    The button "Auto Scene Split" will scann all the frames 
    in the selected range and create new clips on every significant
    scene change. The new clips are added at end of the storyboard.
    (or cliplist)
    You may stop the scan any time with the "Close" button.
