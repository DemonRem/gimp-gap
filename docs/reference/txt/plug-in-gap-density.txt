Change Frame Density

  Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Frames Density

  Changing the frame density results in duplicating frames
  for increasing frame density, and will delete frames
  for decreasing the density.

  This feature is used to change the target framerate and can be
  useful for mixing videos with different framerates without
  changes of the playback speed.
  


  Example:
  If you have created an animation with framerate of 8 frames/sec
  and want to change to a target framerate of 24 frames/sec.
  you should call the "Frame Density" plug-in with a density factor
  of 3 and increasing density mode.

  This makes 2 copies for each of the frames in the selected range.
  If you use playback at the old 8 frames/sec rate the motion
  is 3 times slower now. With the new Rate of 24 frames/sec
  the motion is the same speed as before. 

  The animation before the frame density change (frames 1-9):

     01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09   (original framenumber)

  The animation after frame density change at growing mode and factor 3
  and limited to a frame range from frame 3 to frame 8:

     01 02 03 04 05  06 07 08 09 10 11  12 13 14   15 16 17 18 19 20 21   (new framenumber)
     01 02 03 03 03  04 04 04 05 05 05  06 06 06   07 07 07 08 08 08 09   (original framenumner)
               +  +      +  +     +  +      +  +       +  +     +  +   


  Tip:
    If you use storybard based encoding you can set the stepsize 
    parameter for clips that should be encoded with other target framerates.
    That way you dont need to duplicate or drop your source frames.

  Tip:
     To get smooth motion in the resulting frames you may create 
     2 onionskin layers per frame (for the range "FromFrame" 03 "ToFrame" 20)
     using a setting that blends in the next 2 frames ("FrameReference" +1) 
     at stackposition 0 FromTop of the layerstack
     with opacity of 66% and 50% and without ignoring any background layer(s).
     
     That way you get a cross-fading effect with smoother motion
     when played with 24 frames/sec

     You can find onionskin in this menu:
     <Image>/Video/Onionskin/Configuration
    
     
  Density factors are limited to values from 1.0 upto 100.0.
  float values are supported.
  

  If you want to change from 30 frames/sec down to 15 frames/sec
  then use a density factor of 2 and decreasing density mode
  (increasing/growing mode switched off).
  
  This will delete every 2.nd frame.
  
  There is no undo, so use this feature very carefully.
