Master Properties (Storyboard)

    The master properties dialog window is used to
    create new storyboard files and to view and update properties
    of an existing storyboard file.
    It is a popup dialog of the storyboard editor

    ## refere to Storyboard Dialog
    ## (plug-in-gap-storyboard-edit.txt)

    File:
      The name of the stroyboard file.
      If the dialog was opened via menu "properties" 
      the filename is read only information.
      If invoked via "new" you can specify the filename 
      here and the button "..." opens a filebrowser dialog window
      where you can select the filename.

    Width:
    Height:
      Master size of the target videofile in pixels.
      At encoding time all input frames are
      scaled to this master size.
      (For manually edited storyboard files
      there you can control how to scale the input
      frames individually per clip using
      records of type VID_FIT_SIZE
      see storyboard syntax description for more details.
      ## STORYBOARD_FILE_DOC.txt ####

    Framerate:
      Master framerate of the resulting videofile
      in frames per second.

    Decoder:
      Selection of a preferred video decoder software library.
      If nothing is specified the decoder is selected automatically.
      The decoder setting is only relevant for the clip references
      to videofiles, to specify what software to use for readaccess
      to the videofile.

      
    Samplerate:
      Master samplerate in 1000 samples per second.
      The master samplerate is the target samplerate
      for the resulting audiotrack when storyboard file
      is encoded to a videofile.
      GIMP-GAP creates this track in a pre-processing
      step (in the Master Videoencoder module) as
      composite audiofile by mixing down all
      audiotracks of a storyboard file.
      
    Volume:
      Master volume of the resulting audiotrack,
      where values greater than 1.0 will amplify the volume.
      (with the risk of producing noise on overflow)
      
    AreaFormat:
      This format string triggers automatical logo insertation
      for all handled clips of type MOVIE. 
      The area format string shall contain the placeholder %s
      that is replaced by the basename of the currently processed
      videoclip. The placeholder %06d is replaced by the current
      framenumber.
      The storyboard processing builds the filename of a logo image
      whenever a frame is fetched from a movie clip
      and pastes the logo into the frame in case the logo image exists.
      If the format does not contain any placeholder, the same logo
      will be used in all handled movie clips.

      Frame specific Example:
        AreaFormat: /logo_frames/%s/logo_frame_%06d.xcf
      
        Procesing of frame 7 of movie clip /videos/MY_VIDEO.AVI
        will paste logo image /logo_frames/MY_VIDEO.AVI/logo_frame_000007.xcf

        Procesing of frame 22 of movie clip /videos/YOUR_VIDEO.MPEG
        will paste logo image /logo_frames/YOUR_VIDEO.MPEG/logo_frame_000022.xcf
