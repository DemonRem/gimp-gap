Split Image into Frames

    Start from Menu:
        <Image>/Video/Split Img to Frames


    This feature splits a multilayer image into frames.
    Usually each one of the layers will be stored as
    separate frame image on disk. The name of the
    frame images on disk is built from the image name,
    the framenumberpart and the extension.
    
    Note:
      This feature does not operate on images that
      have already a numberpart in the imagename.
      If you want to split such images, you should
      make a duplicate (Menu: <Image>/Image/Duplicate)
      or rename the image and then try again n the duplicate
      (or the renamed image)
      
    

    Extension:
      The extension defines the last part of the resulting
      framenames. Further it defines the image fileformat.
      Normally .xcf is used to store the frames in 
      the GIMP's native fileformat XCF.

      
 
 
    Inverse Order:
      ON: start with frame 000001 at top layer.
      OFF: start with frame 000001 at background layer.
      
    Flatten:
      ON: Flatten all resulting frames. Flattening replaces
          transparent parts by the background color.
	  (flattening removes the alpha channel that is
	   normally used to store transparency)
      OFF: keep layers 1:1 as they are in the original image.
      
    Only Visible:
      ON: affect only the visible layers and ignore invisible layers.
      OFF: affect all layers.
      
    Digits:
      How many digits to use for the numberpart of
      the resulting frames.
