Renumber Frames

  Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Frames Renumber

  This plug-in renumbers all frames (discfiles) of a video.
  
  First Frame Number:
     Enter the new number for the first frame in this
     entry field.
     All frames of video are renumbered, starting at this
     number.
 
  Digits:
    Here you can enter how many digits (1 up to 8) to use for your frame
    numbers. Framenumbers are filled up with leading zeros to the
    specified number of digits.
    Framenumbers that are greater than the specified number of digits
    will use more digits than specified, but are built without leading zeroes.
    If you choose 1 your framenumbers are built without
    any leading zeroes at all.


  If the frames are numbered in a non-continuous way, you can
  make them continuous with this plug-ins.
  (Most other GIMP-GAP features do not accept non-continuous numbered frames)

  Example:
    you have the frames:
       film_0001.xcf
       film_0007.xcf
       film_0008.xcf

  After running the renumber feature with settings
    First Frame Number: 4
    Digits: 6
 
    the frames will be renumbered as:
 
       film_000004.xcf     # old name was film_0001.xcf
       film_000005.xcf     # old name was film_0007.xcf
       film_000006.xcf     # old name was film_0008.xcf
