Frames Convert

   Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Frames Convert

   Converts multiple frames from one fileformat to another.
    
   Basename:
      Name of one destination frame without the frame number part and without the
      extension.
      
   Extension:
      Extension of the destination frames. The extension also defines the
      fileformat.
      
   Imagetype:
      Keep Type
      Convert to RGB
      Convert to Gray
      Convert to Indexed
      
   Flatten:
      Merge all layers if checked. This check_button should be turned on
      for destination fileformats that can not store multiple layers.
 
   Example1:
      
      If your source frames are XCF-images of imagetype RGB with the names:
       img_000001.xcf
       img_000002.xcf
       img_000003.xcf

      and you want to convert to JPEG's named
        /tmp/scratch_000001.jpg
        /tmp/scratch_000002.jpg
        /tmp/scratch_000003.jpg

      you need the following convert settings:
        From Frame: 1
	To Frame:   3
	Basename:   /tmp/scratch_
	Extension:  .jpg
	Imagetype:  Keep Type
	Flatten:    ON (checked)
      

   Example2:
      
      To convert from RGB JPEG fileformat (.jpg) to GIF (.gif)
      you have to set the destination imagetype "Convert to Indexed",
      because the GIF fileformat can not handle RGB, only GRAY and INDEXED)
              
      Convert to INDEXED reduces the number of colors
      downto 256 (or less).
