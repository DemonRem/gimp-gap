Colormask Filter

    Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Video/Layer/Attributes/Apply Colormask
       
    The colormask filter can apply transparency for pixels matching the colormask image.
    It is intended for processing frames where moving objects can be isolated
    from the non-moving constant background by aplying the constant background
    as colormask on all frames.
    
    The colormask provides more flexibility than the bluebox filter
    because it can operate on frames where the background is not just made of shades
    of the same color.
    But for good results the moving object shall not contain the same colors as the background.
    
    In case the colormask layer has an alpha channel it is used to
    define protected areas, e.g the alpha channel of the colormask controls 
    where the filter shall be applied (opaque) or not (transparent pixels are protected).
    Pixels where the corresponding alpha channel in the colormask is below the specifed
    triggerAlpha value are not affected by the colormask filter.
    This is useful when the colormask filter runs non-interactive
    under control of storyboard render processing
    on frame images that are created internally where the image has no selction.
    
    
    
    The colormask filter is not yet fully implemented.
    
    TODO: add more detailed feature description here when implementation is finished.
