"plug-in-gap-storyboard-player"

Player invoked from storyboard dialog editor plug-in

  (the player hides the HELP Button in case when
   invoked from the storyboard editor dialog,
   because the player is part of the storyboard editor window
   and has its own help menu item)
   


  For more details on the playback related widgets
  see the chapter 
  ##### refere to Player description (plug-in-gap-videoframes-player.txt) #####
