Generate original tone autiotrack (Storyboard)

    This feature generates an audiotrack in the storyboard.
    This audiotrack adds the audio original tone references 
    for all the videoclips of type MOVIE that are found
    in the storyboard.
    (except those clips that are played backwards, pingpong mode
     or at other stepsize than 1.0)

    It is a popup dialog of the storyboard editor.

    Input Audiotrack:
       This refers to the audiotrack number of (all used) inputvideoclips.
       Most videofiles have just one track. 
       DVD's typically store multiple language versions on
       multiple audotracks in their .vob files.

    Output Audiotrack:
       This is the storyboard specific audiotrack number.
         
    Replace Audiotrack
       This flag allows replace of the specified audiotrack
       in the storyboard.

    Notes:
       the generated audiotrack is just a list of references
       to the audiopart of the used videoclips.
       Processing of this list is done as audio preprocessing step
       at encoding in the Master Videoencoder.
       (see Master Videoencoder, Create Composite Audio for more
       information)
