Scale Video Frames

    Start from Menu:
             <Image>/Video/Frames Scale
	     
    With the video scale feature you can scale 
    all frame images in a sequence of numbered frames.

    Load one of the frames and invoke this plug-in from the loaded frame,
    adjust the settings as you like and the plug-in will
    scale all other frames to the selected size when OK is pressed.
    
    Current width and height are displayed as information.
    With "New Width" and  "New Height" you can specify the
    desired new size in pixels.
    
    When the "Reset" button is pressed, the new width and 
    new height values are reset to current values.
    
    With X/Y ratio values you can specify new size as factor,
    A value of 2.0 results in double saize while 0.5 sacles down
    to half size.
    
    The chain button keeps image proportions constant when active.
    With inactive chain button (symbol changes to broken chain)
    width and height may be changed independent.
 
 
    Note:
    GIMP provides different methods for scaling images.
    You can configure the desired methode in the GIMP
    Preferences dialog at "Tool Options"
    where you can select different methods for scaling.

      - None (fastest)
      - Linear
      - Cubic (best)
    
    This plug-in uses the configured methode from the
    preferences menu.
