The libwawplay_client directory
contains copies of the client waveplay-1.4 clientcode parts 
but without the LessTif/MOTIF based gui stuff.
The sourcefiles with the wpc_ prefix are wrapper sources
(added by hof) to build the library and for conditional compile
respecting the -DGAP_DISABLE_WAV_AUDIOSUPPORT switch
without changing the original wavplay sourcecode parts.

The only change i did was replacing the deprecated usage of 
sys_errlist[errno] by g_strerror(errno)

gimp-gap optional uses this lib to act as client for waveplay-1.4
in the video Playback module. The audiosupport still depends on the
wavplay-1.4 serversoftware at runtime.
Therefore you need to install waveplay-1.4 if you have LINUX 
and want audiosupport at runtime.
For Compile and Link the wavplay-1.4 serversoftware is not required.
(even if compiled with audio support eg. without -DGAP_DISABLE_WAV_AUDIOSUPPORT)

If you run into trouble compiling libgapwavplayclient
you should run 
  autogen.sh --disable-audiosupport
at gimp-gap toplevel directory.


Notes:
- I dont know if wavplay will work on other Systems than Linux.

- Where to get the wavplay serversoftware:
